# Sorting Visualization Website  

A Django-based interactive web application for visualizing sorting algorithms step-by-step using bar graphs.  

## Features  
- **Random Array Generation**: Input a number to generate a random array of elements.  
- **Sorting Algorithm Options**: Select from the following algorithms to visualize:  
  - Insertion Sort  
  - Bubble Sort  
  - Quick Sort  
  - Merge Sort  
  - Heap Sort  
  - Cycle Sort  
  - Radix Sort  
  - Counting Sort  
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Watch the sorting process dynamically displayed as a bar graph.  
- **Interactive and User-Friendly**: Intuitive interface with responsive visualizations.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Backend**: Django for server-side processing.  
- **Frontend**: JavaScript for dynamic bar chart visualizations.  
- **Data Exchange**: JSON to transmit sorted data between the backend and frontend.  
- **Hosting**: Locally hosted for demonstration purposes.  

## How It Works  
1. Input a number to generate a random array.  
2. Select a sorting algorithm.  
3. The sorting process is visualized step-by-step with bars representing array elements.  

## Advantages  
- Educational tool for understanding and comparing sorting algorithms.  
- Step-by-step animations make learning sorting techniques engaging and interactive.  
- Combines algorithms, web development, and visual design.  

## Future Improvements  
- Add more sorting algorithms.  
- Allow users to define custom arrays.  
- Deploy the application online for broader accessibility.
