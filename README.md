# Projects Overview

## Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This is a web-based sorting algorithm visualizer that allows users to see how different sorting algorithms work in real-time. Users can select from various algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and more. The visualization is done using bars of different heights, and users can customize the number of elements to be sorted. A runtime feature is also included to analyze sorting speeds.

### Features:
- Supports multiple sorting algorithms.
- Customizable input size.
- Runtime of algorithms.
- Built using Python for backend sorting logic and HTML/CSS (Bootstrap) for frontend visualization.

## Pokémon Encounter & IV Logger Discord Bot
A Discord bot that helps track Pokémon encounters, logs IV percentages, and provides a hunt mode for filtering Pokémon encounters. It also includes automated notifications and temporary channel locking for rare encounters.

### Features:
- Detects Pokémon encounters from embedded messages.
- Logs IV percentages temporarily when using `/mypkinfo` in textual mode.
- Allows users to switch between **Hunt Mode** and **Shiny Mode**.
- Automatically locks the channel for 10 seconds when a rare Pokémon appears.
- Provides IV log management commands.

### Commands:
- `!huntmode` – Toggle between Hunt Mode and Shiny Mode.
- `!ivlogs` – View stored IV logs.
- `!remove_pokemon <Pokemon>` – Remove a specific Pokémon from logs.
- `!clear_ivlogs` – Clear all logged IV data.
